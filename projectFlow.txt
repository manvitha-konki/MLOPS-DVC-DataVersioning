1. Create code.py and add code to it. (It will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
2. git add,commit, push
3. dvc init
4. Now do mkdir "S3" folder (bucket) - where dvc saves all the data
5. tells dvc the location using the following command:
        "dvc remote add -d <variable> <folderName>"
        "dvc remote add -d myRemote S3"
6. saying which data to save through dvc:
        "dvc add data/"
    As data folder is tracking by git it throws an error saying reomve tracking from git to add it into dvc
        "git -rm -r --cached 'data'"
        "git commit -m "stop tracking data"
        "dvc add data/"
        "git add .gitignore .data.dvc"  ----- for tracking the data from git (or say like giving the uniqueu id for every commit in git to data in dvc) 
7. Adding data to S3 by dvc 
        "dvc commit"    
        "dvc push"

Version 1 in S3 - [{"md5": "9a410ef3cefded36046944694d8db8ee", "relpath": "sample.csv"}]
